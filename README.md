# amazon-clone
I built an Amazon Clone using HTML and CSS, replicating the layout of the e-commerce site with a navigation bar, banners, product sections, and footer. This project focuses on UI design, responsiveness, and styling, serving as a strong foundation for future JavaScript or backend integrations.
